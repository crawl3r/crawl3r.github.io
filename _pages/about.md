I should probably do something with this page... here's a quick breakdown:

- Started making websites when I was 14
- Moved into Games Programming for Uni (worked with C, C++, C#, Java, Erlang and OpenGL)
- Joined Games Industry - sucked at it, hopped to Cyber
- Did my MSc - was fun
- Joined industry as a pentester (skid tier)
- Enjoy reverse engineering, exploitation and coding in general
- Would like to get into full time exploit dev or something, but I doubt that will happen. Probably remain as a spare time hobby thing focusing on reversing games, software, kernel stuff, etc.
